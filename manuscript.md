# Dataset Decription
The Roslagsbanan is a railway system operating in Stockholm. As part of an improvement in the transportation system, Stockholm Municipality invested in a new fleet of trains switching from X10p trains to the new X15p. In order to analyze the safety of the new trains, brake tests were conducted. During these tests, the Latronix Track Measurement (LTM) system was mounted on the train. The LTM uses laser beams, and an onboard computer to perform measurements over a railroad track while the train drives on the track at normal speed. 

The data that will be used in this study was collected using the LTM system affixed to a Roslagsbanan vehicle. While the train was running over the sections, the level of each rail, alignment, curvature, cant, gauge, and twist were measured every 256mm. The data was compiled in csv files and was collected between October 2021 and May 2022 with an approximate interval of one month. In other words, a given section of track typically has around six measurement files. The total amount of data is 60 CSV files of 30,000 to 80,000 rows each, for a total of 1.5GB of data.

*These data and measurements are property of Latronix AB of Sweden, and are used with their permission for research and educational purposes only.*

In the CSV files the structure of columns is as follows:

- Marker and Marker_Offset: The kilometre post of the data point, where Marker is in km and Marker_offset is in m. In other words, if Marker=20 and Marker_offset=250.5, the kilometre post is 20,250.5 

- Coordinate_northing,Coordinate_easting, Latitude, Longitude: As their name suggests, they are the coordinates of the data point in northings and eastings, as well as latitude and longitude. 

- Speed: records the speed in km/h at which the measurement was taken. This is especially relevant as different operating speeds give different tolerances in terms of the measured properties. 

- Level_left and Level_right D0, D1, D2, D3: The deviation of the longitudinal level (height) of the left and right rail in mm, compared to its reference position. D0, D1, D2, D3 correspond to different measurement wavelengths of the same data.

- Alignment_left and Alignment_right D0, D1, D2, D3: The deviation in longitudinal alignment ("straightness") of the left and right rail in mm, compared to its reference position. D0, D1, D2, D3 correspond to different measurement wavelengths of the same data.

- Track_gauge: The deviation in the spacing between the rails in mm, from a reference of 891mm.

- Curvature: The curvature of the track at that location, in m^-1.

- Cant: The cant (inclination) of the track at the location, in mm from the horizontal.

- Twist_3m, Twist_6m: The rate of change in cant over a 3m or 6m distance.

- Level_versine_left_5m, Level_versine_right_5m: Derived from Level_left and Level_right, this level deviation in mm corresponds to longitudinal versine measurement of the top of rail over a 5m distance. This historical metric is more commonly used in railway engineering and is thus provided.

- Alignment_versine_left_10m, Alignment_versine_right_10m: Similarly to the versine level, this measure of alignment in mm uses versines over a 10m distance.

Finally, Track_name, Track_class, Station_flag and Link_name,Pos_unfiltered	Pos_filtered, NTP_sync, Cant_D1, Std_level, Std_alignment, Std_cant, Quality_1 are mainly for internal use and not part of the analysis.
			
# Project Proposal
The main goal of this project is to identify patterns in the data, especially the track degradation of certain sections, and thus to analyze the change in railway safety during this time. The first approach will be to define degradation trends and build a model to process the data that finds them automatically. Then, the study will attempt to find external factors which caused the observed trends. The analysis will include graphics of the parameters over time as well as comparing them over the sections to provide a better understanding of the data visually.

This research will help assess system performance, identify possible maintenance schedules, and provide useful data for further research in this area. The study also falls within the scope of developing predictive maintenance in civil engineering and railways. Creating and improving analysis and predictive maintenance models such as this one can contribute to increase safety of rail networks and a higher quality of service for passengers. They will benefit from fewer unplanned service interruptions due to track maintenance and even fewer unsafe tracks causing line closures.

# Exploratory Analysis
## General Dataset Description: 
This document will concentrate on Line 27 of the Roslagsbanan, which links Stockholms Ostra and Karsta. The reason that line 27 was chosen is because it has the most data out of the three line. The primary dataset for line 27 is comprised of sixty ".csv" files, each of which includes a collection of measurements that were gathered from all, or a particular segment of, the line. Track measuring equipment, which was mounted on the trains and operated while the trial run was being conducted, was used to take the measurements. The dates of the measurements range from October 2021 to May 2022.
In addition, the number of measurement runs that are performed on each sector of the track is differentiated from one another according to the relative importance of the sectors. For instance, the section of the track that extends between 27 and 38 kilometers has been measured in more than twenty different time points, whereas other sections do not have such a high number of runs. The map of the lines can be seen below in Figure @fig:geo-map-1. 

![Line map overview of the Roslagsbanan. This study will focus on line 27 to Kårsta.](images/RB-sl-map.png){#fig:geo-map-1 width="4in"}

It is important to keep in mind that the data may require cleaning in some instances. For example, it has numerous NA cells. It also has some questionable data points, particularly during the time when the train was slowing down to a stop or starting to accelerate (i.e. close to 0 speed), which caused some outliers.

The date and time of the measurements are not hardcoded in the .csv document but only mentioned in the file name, as such the code for analyzing will have to take into account the name of the file when making comparisons. 
As shown in Figure @fig:desync-1, the measurement runs are also not completely synchronized, they must be matched or correlated in some way to build a relible model.

## Summary Statistics:
In this section, we will discuss the science of data mining, which is the process of analyzing, and presenting large amounts of data in order to find hidden patterns and trends.
Table 1 shows the general properties of the measurement files. 

**Table 1**: Summary of general properties.

| Properties | Value |
|----------|----------|
| Earliest measurement | 21st October 2021 |
| Latest measurement | 10th May 2022 |
| Line Length | 41.700 km (25.91 miles) |
| Data points per file | 20,000 to over 100,000 |



Table 2 shows the statistical analysis of certain measured parameters in order to show the typical range, mean, median and standard deviation of the values that will be used. 

**Table 2**: Statistical analysis of the parameters for the Ostra-Karsta line, measurement date 02/08/2022. 


| Variable | Mean | Min | Median | Max | Standard Deviation |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Curvature (1/m) | 4.995e-5 | -0.004 | 2.310e-6 |0.004 | 0.001|
| Cant (mm)|1.629| -96.630 | -0.490 |	91.393 |32.158|
| Twist 3m |  -0.003 | -7.542 | -0.001 |	6.703 |1.172|
| Track Gauge Deviation (mm)|  2.010 | -7.989 | 1.779 |19.149 |1.721|
| Alignment Versine (Right) (mm)|  -0.043 | -51.756 | -0.005 |38.235 |2.575|
| Level Versine (Right) (mm) |  -0.003 | -11.951 | 0.039|11.808 |1.348|


It can be observed that the mean and median values are close to 0, which is in accordance with the concept of a railway track having localised imperfections but being smooth on a more global scale. The standard deviation gives some insight as to how the data tends to vary throughout, compared to the generally low mean values. 

## Data Correlation:
An important fact of the parameters considered is that some of them are directly related in a mathematical sense. For example, cant or superelevation is proportional to the curvature, which means that when the track is being built, the superelevation is calculated based on the curvature at a given location, as follows:

$$E_e=\frac{G*V^2*R}{g}$$

Where E_e is balancing superelevation or cant, G (track gauge), g (gravity), and V (line speed) are constants and R is curvature.[@{https://railroads.dot.gov/sites/fra.dot.gov/files/2019-12/Superelevation-Guidance_pdfa.pdf}] 

Similarly, twist describes the rate of change of cant over a certain distance, and thus a close link between them is expected. 

These parameters are summarised in Figure @fig:cant_diag_1 below, courtesy of Kawasaki Track Technology[@{https://www.kawasaki-track.com/pdf/Kawasaki%20LATGMS%20Brochure.pdf}]:

![Summary diagram of the parameters studied in this report. Source: Kawasaki Track Technology LATGMS brochure.](images/CantEtcDiagram.png){#fig:cant_diag_1 width="5in"}

Figure @fig:curv_cant_twist shows these relations among the parameters for the track studied. From the curvature and cant plots, it can be observed that there is a strong relationship between them, as both exhibit similar patterns of variation. However, in the case of twist, similar patterns are not as clear. In spite of the fact that it is known to be mathematically correlated, additional investigation may be required in order to discern the pattern.

![Ostra-Karsta line - Curvature, Cant and Twist vs Location.](images/Karsta-Curv,Cant,Twist.PNG){#fig:curv_cant_twist}

As for the link between gauge and curvature, while there is no strict relationship between them when plotting the two parameters, a somewhat common pattern of variation can be observed. The plots indicate that at higher curvatures, deviation from the original gauge also increases. Figure @fig:gauge-curve1 and Figure @fig:gauge-curve2 evidence this fact. 

![Ostra-Karsta line - Curvature and Gauge vs Location.](images/Karsta_Gauge_Curvature.PNG){#fig:gauge-curve1 width="5in"}

![Ostra-Karsta line - Curvature vs Gauge.](images/Karsta_Gauge_Curvature2.PNG){#fig:gauge-curve2 width="5in"}

In particular, on Figure @fig:gauge-curve2, a general trend resembling an absolute value function can be discerned. Point density is very high around the point (0,0) of the graph, corresponding to straight track and intact gauge. As curvature increases (in the negative or positive), gauge also increases (only in the positive), seemingly showing that the rails tend to be stretched apart from one another in curved sections. This observation could play an important part in the predictive model. 

Finally, Figure @fig:alignment shows the variation of the Alignment along the whole line.

![Ostra-Karsta line - Curvature vs Gauge.](images/Alignment.png){#fig:alignment width="4.5in"}

Here it is intersting to note the outliers at the start and end points. At these locations the train was starting and stopping respectively, thus with a speed close to 0. This leads to unrealistic values which will need to be removed when exploiting the data in a model. 

# Predictive model considerations
Due to the somewhat limited number of independent variables already present inside the measurement set, there may be challenges when making a predictive model. Further evaluation of links between variables in the data will likely be necessary when making the model. 
Notwithstanding, the first part of the predictive model will try and find locations where the track degradation seems to form a clear trend (typically a linear increase in a given direction) over time. Here, time is the independent variable. From an initial analysis of the dataset and general knowledge of railway track engineering, it is likely this predictive model will yield exploitable results.

The second part of the predictive model could take into account external factors, in particular, temperature/weather changes and soil properties if obtainable. This could give us locations prone to developing trends in the short to medium term, which could be investigated by a maintenance team.  However we have envisioned some possible issues, namely that obtaining and translating soil data into something usable by the model may be a challenge, and no link is guaranteed to appear (what if all soils along the line are similar?). A possible approach could be to grade soils based on properties, for example, a very stable soil could get a score of 1, and a "worse" soil from the point of view of building a railway line could get a high score, with appropriate intermediate values. However, obtaining soil data reliably for these locations is proving to be a challenge and may not be an option

Finally, another research path for a predictive model would be to investigate more in depth the link between measured variables that are not mathematically correlated but seem to exhibit some kind of relationship, such as gauge and curvature earlier (although both are meant to be completely independent of a civil engineering point of view). The finality of this is being able to predict the state of certain properties of the track which are complex to measure, using knowledge of established properties that do not require special measuring gear. In this example, the curvature of the track is well-known and extremely stable, but small gauge variations necessitate state-of-the-art apparatus to measure hence the advantage of having a predictive model.
