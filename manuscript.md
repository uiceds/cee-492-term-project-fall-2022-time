# Dataset Decription
The Roslagsbanan is a railway system operating in Stockholm. As part of an improvement in the transportation system, Stockholm Municipality invested in a new fleet of trains switching from X10p trains to the new X15p. In order to analyze the safety of the new trains, brake tests were conducted. During these tests, the Latronix Track Measurement (LTM) system was mounted on the train. The LTM uses laser beams, and an onboard computer to perform measurements over a railroad track while the train drives on the track at normal speed. 

The data that will be used in this study was collected using the LTM system affixed to a Roslagsbanan vehicle. While the train was running over the sections, the level of each rail, alignment, curvature, cant, gauge, and twist were measured every 256mm. The data was compiled in csv files and was collected between October 2021 and May 2022 with an approximate interval of one month. In other words, a given section of track typically has around six measurement files. The total amount of data is 60 CSV files of 30,000 to 80,000 rows each, for a total of 1.5GB of data.

*These data and measurements are property of Latronix AB of Sweden, and are used with their permission for research and educational purposes only.*

In the CSV files the structure of columns is as follows:

- Marker and Marker_Offset: The kilometre post of the data point, where Marker is in km and Marker_offset is in m. In other words, if Marker=20 and MArker_offset=250.5, the kilometre post is 20,250.5 

- Coordinate_northing,Coordinate_easting, Latitude, Longitude: As their name suggests, they are the coordinates of the data point in northings and eastings, as well as latittude and longitude. 

- Speed: records the speed in km/h at which the measurement was taken. This is especially relevant as different operating speeds give different tolerances in terms of the measured properties. 

- Level_left and Level_right D0, D1, D2, D3: The deviation of the longitudinal level (height) of the left and right rail in mm, compared to its reference position. D0, D1, D2, D3 correspond to different measurement wavelengths of the same data.

- Alignment_left and Alignment_right D0, D1, D2, D3: The deviation in longitudinal alignment ("straightness")of the left and right rail in mm, compared to its reference position. D0, D1, D2, D3 correspond to different measurement wavelengths of the same data.

- Track_gauge: The deviation in the spacing between the rails in mm, from a reference of 891mm.

- Curvature: The curvature of the track at that location, in m^-1.

- Cant: The cant (inclination) of the track at the location, in mm from the horizontal.

- Twist_3m, Twist_6m: The rate of change in cant over a 3m or 6m distance.

- Level_versine_left_5m, Level_versine_right_5m: Derived from Level_left and Level_right, this level deviation in mm corresponds to longitudinal versine measurement of the top of rail over a 5m distance. This historical metric is more commonly used in railway engineering and is thus provided.

- Alignment_versine_left_10m, Alignment_versine_right_10m: Similarly to the versine level, this measure of alignment in mm uses versines over a 10m distance.

Finally, Track_name, Track_class, Station_flag and Link_name,Pos_unfiltered	Pos_filtered, NTP_sync, Cant_D1, Std_level, Std_alignment, Std_cant, Quality_1 are mainly for internal use and not part of the analysis.
			
# Project Proposal
The main goal of this project is to identify patterns in the data, especially the track degradation of certain sections, and thus to analyze the change in railway safety during this time. The first approach will be to define degradation trends and build a model to process the data that finds them automatically. Then, the study will attempt to find external factors which caused the observed trends. The analysis will include graphics of the parameters over time as well as comparing them over the sections to provide a better understanding of the data visually.

This research will help assess system performance, identify possible maintenance schedules, and provide useful data for further research in this area. The study also falls within the scope of developing predictive maintenance in civil engineering and railways. Creating and improving analysis and predictive maintenance models such as this one can contribute to increase safety of rail networks and a higher quality of service for passengers. They will benefit from fewer unplanned service interruptions due to track maintenance and even fewer unsafe tracks causing line closures.

# Exploratory Analysis
## General Dataset Description: 
The main dataset is composed of 60 .csv files of measurements taken on part of the railway tracks of the Roslagsbanan network in Stockholm. They are dated from October 2021 to May 2022 and the measurements were made using track measuring equipment installed on the trains and working during the trial run.

Each file corresponds to a specific measurement run, on a given part of the track. Additionally, each section of the track has a different number of measurement runs, depending on the importance of the sections. For example, the segment between the 27 and 38 km points comprises more than 20 different runs (usually traveling north and then south on the same day) while other sections do not have such a number of measurements. `Figure 1` shows a map with the lines that are taken into account in this document. `(we should cite all the Figures in the text, I don't know how to do that automatic)`

``. `It looks interesting to analyse`

![Line map overview of the Roslagsbanan. This study will focus on line 27 to Kårsta.](images/RB-sl-map.png){#fig:geo-map-1 width="5in"}

It should be noted that in some cases the data needs to be cleaned. For example, it contains many N/A cells, as well as some questionable data points, especially when the train was coming to a stop, which produced some outliers. `[plot showing what happens with 0 speed?]. I like this idea too`

The date and time of the measurements are not hardcoded in the .csv file but only mentioned in the file name, as such the code for analyzing will have to take into account the name of the file when making comparisons. As shown in `Figure 2`, the measurement runs are not completely synchronized, they must match or correlate in some way to clearly interpret the results. `(WHAT IS X AND Y IN THE FIGURE?). I think that the letter is too small, maybe we could make it bigger`

## Statistics Analysis:
[Stats summary about size, distance covered, frequency of measurements, others?]

| Statistic | Value |
|----------|----------|
| Earliest measurement | 21st October 2021 |
| Latest measurement | 10th May 2022 |
| Line Length | 41.700 km (25.91 miles) |
| Data points per file | 20,000 to over 100,000 |
| File size |  |

Table 1: Summary Table. {#tbl:sum-table-1}

`Something is weird with the title of this table, it appears something else in the pdf version`
`We could include in this section the mean and standard deviation of the columns, for instance, gauge, alignment, height (that wee know they should be the same in the entire longitude)`

## Data Correlation:
An important fact of the parameters considered is that some of them are directly related in a mathematical sense. For example, the parameter cant is proportional to the curvature, which means that when the track is being built, the superelevation is calculated based on the curvature at a given location, as follows:

\(\frac{G*V^2}{gR})

Where E_e is balancing superelevation or cant, G (track gauge), g (gravity), and V (line speed) are constants and R is curve radius, the inverse of curvature.[1] 

Similarly, twist describes the rate of change of cant over a certain distance, and thus a close correlation between them is expected. These parameters are summarised in Figure @fig:cant_diag_1 below, courtesy of Kawasaki Track Technology:

![Summary diagram of the parameters studied in this report. Source: Kawasaki Track Technology](images/CantEtcDiagram.png){#fig:cant_diag_1 width="5in"}

Figure @fig:curv_cant_twist shows these relations among the parameters for the Karsta line. From the curvature and cant plots, it can be observed that there is a strong relationship between them, as both exhibit similar patterns. However, in the case of twist correlation with the other variables, similar patterns may not be very clear. More analysis might be done on this line. 

![**Ostra-Karsta line - Curvature, Cant and Twist vs Location.**](images/Karsta-Curv-Cant-Twist.PNG){#fig:curv_cant_twist}

As for Gauge and Curvature, while there is no strict relationship between them when plotting the two parameters, it can be observed that at higher curvatures, the distance between tracks also increases. Figure @fig:gauge-curve1 and Figure @fig:gauge-curve2 show this fact.

# Predictive modelling

Due to the somewhat limited amount of independent variables already present inside the measurement set, there may be challenges. Correlation plots can help us determine links between variables and what model to create.  
The first part of the predictive model will try and find locations where the track degradation seems to form a clear trend (typically a linear increase in a given direction) over time. Here, time is the independent variable. From an initial analysis of the dataset, it is likely this predictive model will yield some results (picture of a steady trend?)
The second part of the predictive model we would like to create would take into account external factors, in particular temperature/weather changes and soil properties if obtainable. This could give us locations prone to developing trends in the short to medium term, which could be investigated by a maintenance team.  However we have envisioned some possible issues, namely that obtaining and translating soil data into something usable by the model may be a challenge, and no link is guaranteed to appear (what if all soils are similar?). A possible approach could be to grade soils based on properties, for example a very stable soil could get a score of 1 and a worse soil from the point of view of building a railway line could get a score of 4 (or higher/lower), with appropriate intermediate values. We could look into D30/D10/D60 values.
