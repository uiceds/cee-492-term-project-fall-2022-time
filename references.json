    "abstract": "In a railroad track, the inherent and small geometrical deviations in the position of rails from their ideal design states constitute imperfections that can have a significant impact on the safety and the rate of degradation of the rail system. These deviations are measured by various technologies and further assessed using various algorithms and statistical techniques to quantify the condition of the system. This paper reviews the existing research regarding the collection of track geometry data, analysis of degradation, and the associated safety and maintenance decisions. The knowledge gaps in the existing literature are identified and possible future research directions are suggested. The review can be used as a reference by practitioners and researchers to determine optimal practices for assuring the safety of tracks.",

    "abstract": "The website Sci-Hub enables users to download PDF versions of scholarly articles, including many articles that are paywalled at their journal’s site. Sci-Hub has grown rapidly since its creation in 2011, but the extent of its coverage has been unclear. Here we report that, as of March 2017, Sci-Hub’s database contains 68.9% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and 85.1% of articles published in toll access journals. We find that coverage varies by discipline and publisher, and that Sci-Hub preferentially covers popular, paywalled content. For toll access articles, we find that Sci-Hub provides greater coverage than the University of Pennsylvania, a major research university in the United States. Green open access to toll access articles via licit services, on the other hand, remains quite limited. Our interactive browser at https://greenelab.github.io/scihub allows users to explore these findings in more detail. For the first time, nearly all scholarly literature is available gratis to anyone with an Internet connection, suggesting the toll access business model may become unsustainable.",
