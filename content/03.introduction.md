# Dataset Decription
Roslagsbanan is a railway system operating in Stockholm. As part of an improvement in the transportation system, the Stockholm Municipality invested in a new float of trains switching from X10p trains to X15p ones. In order to analyze the safety of the system, break tests were conducted. 

The data was collected using the LTM system affixed to a Roslagsbanan vehicle. While the train was running over the sections, it was measured the level of each rail, alignment, curvature, and twist every 256mm. `(WHAT ARE EXACLTY THE COLUMNS THAT THE DATASET HAS? UNITS? DESCRIPTION OF THE PARAMETERS. WHO DOES IT BELONG TO? IS THERE ANY LINK TO SEE THE DATA?` 

The data was compiled in csv files and was collected between October 2021 and May 2022 with an approximate interval of one month.

# Project proposal
The main goal of this project is to identify patterns in the data, especially the track degradation of the road sections, and thus to analyze railway safety during this time. The analysis will include graphics of the parameters over time as well as comparing them over the sections to provide a better understanding of the data visually. `(ANY OTHER KIND OF ANALYSIS?)`

This research may help assess system performance, identify possible maintenance schedules, and provide useful data for further research in this area.
