# Exploratory Analysis
Dataset description: 
The main dataset is composed of 60 .csv files, dated between October 2021 and May 2022. These files correspond to measurements performed on a railway track forming part of the Roslagsbanan network in Stockholm, using a track measurement device affixed to a train running on the track during test runs.
Each file corresponds to a certain measurement run, over a given section of track, and different sections of track have varying amounts of measurement runs. The reason for this is that the engineers monitoring the track wished to monitor certain areas more closely, thus doing more frequent measurements.

In the files, the metrics listed in the introduction are recorded, but it should be noted that the files require cleaning as they comprise numerous N/A cells, as well as somewhat questionable datapoints (especially when the train was coming to a stop, some outliers seem to have been generated [plot showing what happens with 0 speed?]. 
The date and time of the measurement is not hardcoded inside the csv but only mentioned in the file name, as such the code for analysing will have to take into account the name of the file when making comparisons. 
Measurement runs are not perfectly synced with each other as shown on [figure], they will have to somehow be matched or correlated to clearly interpret the results.
